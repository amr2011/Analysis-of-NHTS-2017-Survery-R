National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) is conducted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in order to examine the travel behavior of American public. This is the only source of data that helps in
analyzing the trends in personal and household travel including the daily non-commercial travel by all
modes, characteristics of the people traveling, their household and their vehicles.

The goal of this project is to apply model techniques and statistical concepts on the NHTS Survey 2017 dataset to derive meaningful insights about the households travel behaviors and underlying patterns if any. The major steps undertaken were:
1. Data cleaning and exploration
2. Variable selection
3. Factor Analysis
3. Univariate analysis
4. Bivariate analysis
5. Finding Interactions
5. Building the OLS models for various combinations of the variables
6. Analyzing the output and deriving insights from the models
